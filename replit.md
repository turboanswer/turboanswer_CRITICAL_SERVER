### Key Features
- **Multi-Model AI System**: 4 tiers - Free (Gemini 2.5 Flash), Pro ($6.99/mo - Gemini Pro), Research ($15/mo - Gemini 3.1 Pro + Deep Research), Enterprise ($50/mo - Research access + shareable 6-digit code for up to 5 team members, 33% savings vs individual plans). All Gemini-powered with automatic fallback on rate limits. Research tier includes Pro access. Enterprise includes Research access. Custom team plans available via support@turboanswer.it.com for teams larger than 5.
- **Deep Research Mode**: Removed as a separate toggle. Research/Enterprise tier now always uses Gemini 3.1 Pro (`gemini-3.1-pro-preview`) at full depth on every message — expert-level system prompt with 8192 max tokens, temp 0.1, thorough structured responses. No toggle needed.
- **Voice Command Features**: Speech recognition (Web Speech API), "Turbo" assistant name, optional "Hey Turbo" wake word, auto-send, text-to-speech, and visual feedback.
- **Comprehensive Knowledge Coverage**: Expert-level knowledge in technical, scientific, creative, business, and general domains, including real-time weather and world time zone intelligence.
- **Subscription Management**: PayPal Subscriptions API integration for Pro ($6.99/month), Research ($15/month), and Enterprise ($50/month) plans. All paid plans include a 7-day free trial (no charge on signup day). Payment popups trigger from model selector. Uses PayPal REST API with auto-created billing plans. Plans auto-recreate with trial period on startup if missing. Current plan IDs: Pro P-5T439024E40002735NGU42YY, Research P-3J114811P66183426NGU42YY, Enterprise P-8MA89259B73604813NGU42YY. Enterprise subscribers get a secure 6-digit numeric code saved to their account (persists across sessions) to share with up to 5 team members for Research access. Custom pricing available for larger teams via support email.
- **Account Management**: Delete account functionality in AI settings with PayPal auto-cancellation and complete data removal.
- **Customer Support**: Email (support@turboanswer.it.com), Phone (866-467-7269), Hours: Mon-Fri 9:30am-6pm EST.
- **Employee Management API**: Endpoints for user management (ban, flag, suspend) and audit logging.
- **Admin Panel**: Five-tab interface (Overview, Users, Subscriptions, System & Debug, Alerts). Subscription management with modify/cancel/grant-complimentary (with duration: 1-4 months or forever). System health monitoring for DB/PayPal/AI. Diagnostics with auto-fix. Outage detection with rate-limited notifications. Complimentary access auto-expires when duration lapses. Proactive self-diagnosis runs every 5 minutes checking all services and auto-fixing issues.
- **Performance & Scalability**: API rate limiting (200 req/min general, 30/15min auth, 30/min AI), response compression (gzip), in-memory response caching (15s TTL) for expensive admin endpoints, optimized DB connection pool (max 20 connections, connection reuse), widget session limits (10K max sessions with TTL eviction), graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup.
- **Content Moderation System**: Automatic profanity/threat detection on user messages. Flagged users are auto-suspended with admin notifications sent to the admin panel showing full user details, flagged content, and action taken.
- **Crisis Support Bot**: Dedicated AI companion for mental health crisis support with AES-256-GCM encrypted conversations. Fully private - exempt from content moderation, no admin access, no data shared with authorities. Includes crisis hotline resources (988, Crisis Text Line). Users can delete all crisis data permanently. Specialized Gemini-powered AI with safety settings disabled for sensitive topic support.
- **AI Image Generation**: Integration with OpenAI DALL-E 3 for image generation in the Image Studio (`/image-studio`).
- **AI Video Generation (Video Studio)**: Full Video Studio at `/video-studio` powered by Google Veo. Backend uses `veo-3.0-generate-preview` with fallback to `veo-2.0-generate-001` via `predictLongRunning` API + polling. Supports 16:9 and 9:16 aspect ratios, 5 or 8 second durations, style presets, and prompt ideas. Returns base64 video data URL. Requires Pro/Research/Enterprise tier. Accessible via "Videos" button in chat header.

Approved users get `isBetaTester = true` on their account. Beta testers see a green flask button in the chat header to submit categorized feedback (bugs, features, UI, performance). Admin panel has a dedicated "Beta Testing" tab showing all applications (pending/reviewed) and all feedback notes, plus email template modal for sending approval/denial emails with optional denial reason.
