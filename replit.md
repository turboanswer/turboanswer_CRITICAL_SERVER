Proactive self-diagnosis runs every 5 minutes checking all services and auto-fixing issues.
- **Performance & Scalability**: API rate limiting (200 req/min general, 30/15min auth, 30/min AI), response compression (gzip), in-memory response caching (15s TTL) for expensive admin endpoints, optimized DB connection pool (max 20 connections, connection reuse), widget session limits (10K max sessions with TTL eviction), graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup.
