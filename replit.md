# Turbo Answer - Advanced AI Assistant

## Overview

Turbo Answer is a sophisticated AI assistant application that combines a React (TypeScript) frontend with an Express.js backend, powered by Google Gemini and other advanced AI models. It offers comprehensive knowledge across technical, scientific, and general domains, enhanced with voice commands and a modern user interface. The project also supports mobile app capabilities via Capacitor and includes a B2B embeddable AI widget system. The core vision is to deliver ultimate intelligence, ultra-fast responses, and extensive coverage across professional fields through a revolutionary multi-model AI system, providing various tiers from free to enterprise, including specialized features like Code Studio, AI Video Studio, and a Crisis Support Bot.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui, dark/light theme, mobile-first, floating bubble backgrounds, chat bubble styling.
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript, Node.js (ES modules)
- **API**: RESTful
- **AI Integration**: Multi-model AI system with intelligent routing (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, xAI, Llama, Mistral, Cohere).

### Database
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Schema**: Shared definitions in `/shared/schema.ts`
- **Migration**: Drizzle Kit

### Key Features
- **Multi-Model AI System**: Tiered access (Free, Pro, Research, Enterprise) with intelligent routing based on query complexity. Simple queries default to Gemini Flash Lite, while complex Research/Enterprise queries use Claude Opus 4.5 primary with Gemini 3.1 Pro fallback.
- **Voice Command**: Speech recognition, "Turbo" assistant name, optional wake word, auto-send, text-to-speech.
- **Comprehensive Knowledge**: Expert-level knowledge across various domains, including real-time weather and time zones.
- **Subscription Management**: PayPal Subscriptions API for plan management, including a 7-day free trial.
- **Admin Panel**: Five-tab interface for user, subscription, system, and alert management, including complimentary access and proactive self-diagnosis.
- **Performance**: API rate limiting, response compression, in-memory caching for expensive endpoints, optimized DB connection pool.
- **Security**: SMS phone verification via Twilio on registration (6-digit OTP with crypto-secure generation, rate limiting: 3 sends per 15 min, 5 max verification attempts); HTTP security headers on every response (X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, HSTS, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, CSP in production); passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12); intrusion detection middleware (DDoS >300 req/min auto-block, SQL/XSS injection pattern scanning, brute force auth tracking >10 fails = IP block, directory scanning detection, 10-min auto-unblock); CSRF origin validation on all mutating API requests; conversation ownership enforcement (IDOR protection) on all /api/conversations/:id endpoints with admin canViewAllChats bypass; session secret requires SESSION_SECRET env var in production (random fallback in dev).
- **Content Moderation**: Automatic profanity/threat detection with user suspension and admin notifications.
- **Crisis Support Bot**: Dedicated, private, AES-256-GCM encrypted AI for mental health support, exempt from moderation.
- **Media Studio**: Enterprise-exclusive video and photo editor with filters, text overlays, and AI-powered suggestions.
- **AI Scanner**: Free feature to read, transcribe, and summarize images using Gemini vision.
- **AI Video Generation**: Research/Enterprise feature powered by Google Veo 3.1, supporting video generation from text prompts.
- **Code Studio**: An in-browser IDE add-on with complexity-based pricing, Monaco editor, multi-file support, and Gemini 3.1 Pro integration.
- **Embeddable AI Widget**: Universal JavaScript widget for website integration.
- **Promo Code System**: Database-driven system for discounts and free access.
- **Beta Testing Program**: Public application and feedback system for new features.
- **Automated Email System**: Brevo-powered transactional emails for welcome (on registration), subscription signup, plan switch, cancellation, and payment failure. PayPal payment-failed webhook at `POST /api/paypal/webhook` — register this URL in the PayPal developer dashboard under your app's webhook settings for the `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.PAYMENT.FAILED` event.
