# Turbo Answer - Advanced AI Assistant

## Overview

Turbo Answer is a sophisticated AI assistant application that combines a React (TypeScript) frontend with an Express.js backend, powered by Google Gemini and other advanced AI models. It offers comprehensive knowledge across technical, scientific, and general domains, enhanced with voice commands and a modern user interface. The project also supports mobile app capabilities via Capacitor and includes a B2B embeddable AI widget system. The core vision is to deliver ultimate intelligence, ultra-fast responses, and extensive coverage across professional fields through a revolutionary multi-model AI system, providing various tiers from free to enterprise, including specialized features like Code Studio, AI Video Studio, and a Crisis Support Bot.
