## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Authentication**: Custom email/password auth with bcrypt hashing and PostgreSQL session storage. Admin auto-detection for support@turboanswer.it.com
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Dark/light theme with TurboAnswer branding, mobile-first optimization, floating bubble backgrounds, chat bubble message design, theme toggle in header.

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES modules
- **API Style**: RESTful API endpoints
- **AI Integration**: Multi-model AI system with intelligent routing (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, xAI, Llama, Mistral, Cohere, etc.)
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth (OpenID Connect via Passport.js) with PostgreSQL session storage

### Database Strategy
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect

### Key Features
- **Multi-Model AI System**: 4 tiers - Free (Gemini 2.5 Flash), Pro ($6.99/mo - Gemini Pro), Research ($30/mo - Antigravity + Gemini 3.1 Pro + AI Video Studio), Enterprise ($100/mo - Research access + shareable 6-digit code for up to 5 team members, 44% savings vs individual Research plans). All Gemini-powered with automatic fallback on rate limits. Research tier includes Pro access. Enterprise includes Research access. Custom team plans available via support@turboanswer.it.com for teams larger than 5.
- **Smart Model Routing**: Complexity classifier in `server/services/multi-ai.ts` routes Research/Enterprise queries: simple queries (short, factual, greetings, <220 chars without technical signals) → Gemini Flash Lite (2000 tokens, temp 0.4); complex queries (code blocks, technical keywords like implement/algorithm/architecture/optimize/debug, multi-step, >220 chars) → Gemini 3.1 Pro (8192 tokens, temp 0.1). Free/Pro tiers always use Flash Lite. This saves cost without degrading quality since Flash handles simple questions equally well.
- **Voice Command Features**: Speech recognition (Web Speech API), "Turbo" assistant name, optional "Hey Turbo" wake word, auto-send, text-to-speech, and visual feedback.
- **Comprehensive Knowledge Coverage**: Expert-level knowledge in technical, scientific, creative, business, and general domains, including real-time weather and world time zone intelligence.
- **Subscription Management**: PayPal Subscriptions API integration for Pro ($6.99/month), Research ($30/month), and Enterprise ($100/month) plans. All paid plans include a 7-day free trial (no charge on signup day). Payment popups trigger from model selector. Uses PayPal REST API with auto-created billing plans. Plans auto-recreate with trial period on startup if missing. Plans auto-recreate on server restart with correct prices. Current prices: Pro $6.99, Research $30, Enterprise $100. Plan IDs regenerate automatically when prices change. Enterprise subscribers get a secure 6-digit numeric code saved to their account (persists across sessions) to share with up to 5 team members for Research access. Custom pricing available for larger teams via support email.
- **Account Management**: Delete account functionality in AI settings with PayPal auto-cancellation and complete data removal.
- **Customer Support**: Email (support@turboanswer.it.com), Phone (866-467-7269), Hours: Mon-Fri 9:30am-6pm EST.

System health monitoring for DB/PayPal/AI. Diagnostics with auto-fix. Outage detection with rate-limited notifications. Complimentary access auto-expires when duration lapses. Proactive self-diagnosis runs every 5 minutes checking all services and auto-fixing issues.
- **Performance & Scalability**: API rate limiting (200 req/min general, 30/15min auth, 30/min AI), response compression (gzip), in-memory response caching (15s TTL) for expensive admin endpoints, optimized DB connection pool (max 20 connections, connection reuse), widget session limits (10K max sessions with TTL eviction), graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup.
